# Theorem 3.1


Every matrix is row equivalent to a unique matrix in reduced row echelon form.

__Proof:__ Suppose A and B are two reduced row echelon forms of the same m x n matrix. We need to show that A = B.
We use induction o nthe number $n$ of columns.

n = 1: start with an m x 1 matrix with reduced row echelon forms A & B.
We need to show A = B.

$$A\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
0\\
\dots\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}

or

\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
\dots\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$


$$B\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
0\\
\dots\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}

or

\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
0\\
\dots\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

A and B are row equivalent therefore A = B

Induction induction blah blah blah
