# The Three Possible Outcomes of gauss jordan elimination

Every matrix is row equivalent to a unique marix in reduced row echelon form. (Theorem 3.1)

1. There is a pivot in the rightmost column. (No solution - inconsistent linear system)
2. There is a pivot in every column except for the last one. (Unique solution)
3. Last column and one of the other columns have no pivot. (Free variable, infinitley many sols.)
