# Linear Systems and Matrices

Elementary operations transform a linear system into an equivalent linear system which is easier to solve. Reduced row echelon form.

## Shorthand for writing out linear systems

 - Matrices a'la spec


In general if you have a linear system with m equations in n unkowns it can be represented by its augmented matrix.

$a_{ij}$ is the entry at $(i,j)$
