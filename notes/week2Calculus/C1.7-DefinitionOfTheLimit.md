# Definition of the Limit

Let $f$ be a function define on a domain the includes alkl values close to $c$, but not $c$ itself.

For example, the domain could be a set in the form
$$(a,c)\cup(c,b)=(a,b)/{c},a<c<b$$
We say the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is the real number $L$ if the values of $f(x)$ get closer and closer to $L$ and $x$ gets closer and closer to $c$ (with $x\neq c$).

We write: $$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$$



- A limit may not exist, even if $f(c)$ is defined.
- A limit may exist, even if $f(c)$ is undefined.
