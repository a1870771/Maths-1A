# The Inverse of a One to One Function

- Let $f(x)$ with domain $D$ and range $R$ be one-to-one
- Let $y \in R = \{f(x)|x\in D\}$
- Since $f$ is one-to-one, there is a unique $x \in D$ such that $f(x)=y$
- Denote this unique $x$ by $f^{-1}(y)$. This defines a function $f^{-1}: R -> D$, the inverse function of $f$.

$$f^{-1}(f(x))=x,\; x\in D$$
and
$$f^{-1}(f(y))=y,\; y\in R$$

If $f(x)$ is one-to-one, we also say that $f$ is __invertible__.

__Note__: $f^{-1}(x) \neq 1/{f(x)}$


## How to find the inverse of a function

1. Make sure function is one-to-one
2. Write $y=f(x)$
3. Solve the equation for $x$ to obtain $x=f(y)$
4. If we need $f^{-1}$ as a function of $x$, swap $x$ and $y$.

## The graph of an inverse function

Simple as reflecting the graph of the original function over the line $y=x$.
