# Definition of a Function: Domain and Range

## Definition of a Function

Let __D__ be a set of real numbers.

A function __f__ is a rule (or a set of rules) that assigns to each number $x$ in __D__ a unique real number called $f(x)$.

The set __D__ is called the domain of $f$.

The range of $f$ is the set of all values of $f(x)$, that is
$$\mathbf{R}=\{f(x)|x  \in \mathbf{D}\}$$

## Notating Domain and Range: Interval Notation

Intervals are sets of real numbers between two endpoints.

We use square brackets to denote intervals which include endpoints, and round parentheses for intervals not including endpoints.

- $(1,2)=\{x|1<x<2\}$ is an __open__ interval (excludes end points)
- $[1,2]=\{x|1\le x\le 2\}$ is an __closed__ interval (includes end points)
- We can have mixed combinations such as $(1,2],[1.2)$.
- Whereas $[2,1)=\{x|2\le x< 1\}$ is the empty set.

## Bounded and Unbounded Intervals

- If an interval is __bounded__, we can find real numbers __m__ and __M__ such that every number $x$ in the interval satisfies $m\le x\le M$.
- If an interval is not bounded, we say that it is unbounded.
- $(a, \infin)=\{x|a<x\}$ with $a$ a real number is an unbounded interval, since there is no real number $M$ such that $x\le M$ for every $x$ in the interval.
