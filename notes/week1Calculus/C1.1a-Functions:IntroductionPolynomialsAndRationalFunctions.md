# Functions: introduction, polynomials and rational functions

Functions encapsulate the relationship between __variables__.

Generally denoted $y=f(x)$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

- $x$ is the independant variable (input)
- $y$ is the dependant variable (output)
- $f$ tells us what to do to $x$ in order to get the output $f(x)$

## Polynomials

$$p(x) = a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{1}x+a_{0}$$
Is a polynomial __function__, each of the $a_{0},a_{1},...a_{n}$ are (constant) real numbers. If $a_{n}\neq0$, then $n$ is the degree of $p(x)$.
### Special Cases

- $n\le1$, __linear functions__ $p(x)=ax+c$. This includes constant functions $p(x)=c$ (independant of $x$).
- $n = 2$: quadratic functions
- $n=3$: cubic functions

## Rational Functions

If $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomial functions, then $r(x)={p(x)}/{q(x)}$ is a __rational function__.

Note that when $q(x)=0$, $r(x)$ is undefined.
