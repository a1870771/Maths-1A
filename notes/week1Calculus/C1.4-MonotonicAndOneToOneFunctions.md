# Monotonic and One-to-One Functions

A function is __increasing__ if $f(x_1)<f(x_2)$ for any $x_1 < x_2$ in __D__.

Similarly, a function is __decreasing__ if $f(x_1)>f(x_2)$ for any $x_1 < x_2$ in __D__.

A function is __monotonic__ if it is either increasing or decreasing.

A function is one-to-one if for any $x_1, x_2 \in \mathbf{D}$, if $x_1 \neq x_2$, then $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$.

Equivalently, $f$ is one-to-one provided if $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, for $x_1, x_2 \in \mathbf{D}$, then it must be the case that $x_1=x_2$.

A function is one-to-one if and only if any horizontal line meets the graph of $f$ at most once. If there was at least one horizontal line which touched the graph twice or more, then we would have a $y$ value which corresponds to two or more $x$ values. Then the function could not be one-to-one.

If a function is monotonic, then it is definitley one-to0-one, but if a function is one-to-one, that does not mean that it is definitley monotonic. It is possible to make a non-monotonic function monotonic (and hence one-to-one), by restricting its domain.
