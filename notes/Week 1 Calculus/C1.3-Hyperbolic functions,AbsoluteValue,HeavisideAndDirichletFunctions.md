# Hyperbolic functions, absolute value, Heaviside and Dirichlet functions
##  The hyperbolic Functions
The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the exponential function. The most important are sinh, cosh and tanh.

$$sinh={e^x-e^{-x}}/2$$

$$cosh={e^x+e^{-x}}/2$$

$$tanh={sinhx/coshx}$$



Dirichlet function is the rational number one
