# Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

## Exponential Functions

Take the form $f(x)=a^x$, where $a$ is a __positive__ real number (constant).

__The__ exponential function:
$$f(x)=e^x=exp^x$$
Where $e$ is Euler's number,a fundamental mathematical constant $\approx2.71828$.

If $a\ge 1$, the function will always be increasing and vice versa.

## Logarithmic Functions
If $x=a^y (a>0, a\ne1)$, then $log_ax=y$.
- $log_ax$ is the power to which we must raise $a$ to get $x$, which means $a^{log_ax}=x$ and $log_a(a^x)=x$
- Hence we much require that $x>0$.

Log to the base $e$ is called the __natural logarithm__ denoted $ln(x)$
