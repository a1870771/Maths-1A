# Elementary Operations and Gauss-Jordan Elimination
$$x_{1}+x_{2}-x_{3}=0$$
$$x_{1}+2x_{2}+x_{3}=-1$$
$$2x_{1}+x_{2}-3x_{3}=2$$
$$and$$
$$x_{1}=4$$
$$x_{2}=-3$$
$$x_{3}=1$$
These systems are equivalent!
## Gauss-Jordan Elimination
Takes a linear system of equations and through elementary operations approaches a simpler system of linear equations.

Elementary Operations:
1) Multiply an equation by a non-zero real number.
2) Interchange two equations.
3) Add a multiple of an equation to another equation.

Each of these operations is __reversable__.
