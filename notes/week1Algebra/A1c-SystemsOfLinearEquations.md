# Systems of Linear Equations

$$a_{11}x_{1}+a_{12}x_{2}+...+a_{1n}x_{n}=b_{1}$$

$$a_{21}x_{1}+a_{22}x_{2}+...+a_{2n}x_{n}=b_{2}$$

$$...$$

$$a_{m1}x_{1}+a_{m2}x_{2}+...+a_{mn}x_{n}=b_{m}$$

m equations with n unknowns

"m x n linear system" or "size m x n"

$a_{ij}, i=1,...,m, j=1,...,n$ __coefficicients__

A vector $(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ is a __solution__ of  the linear system is it is a solution to  every equation in the system.


## Terminology:

1) THe set of all solutions of a linear system is called the __solution set__ of the linear system.
2) Two linear systems are __equivalent__ if they have the same solution set

In practise, linear systems are gigantic.
