# Linear Equations

A __linear equation__ in n __variables__ 

$x_{1}, x_{2},..., x_{n}$ looks like this:
$$a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+...+a_{n}x_{n} = b$$
$a_{1}, a_{2},...,a_{n},b$ - real numbers

eg: $2x_{1}-1.3x_{2}+sin(\pi/3)x_{3} - x_{4} = 1$ is a linear equation in 4 variables

These equations are __not__ linear:

$$x_{1}^2 + 2x_{1}x_{2}+x_{3}=4$$
$$sin(x_{1})+2x_{2}+e^{x_{3}} = 5$$
(not allowed to multiply the x's and not allowed to apply functions)

To __solve__ a linear eqn $a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+...+a_{n}x_{n} = b$ you need to find real numbers $x_{1}, x_{2},..,x_{n}$ which __satisfy__ the eqn. You say the __vector__ ($x_{1}, x_{2},..., x_{n}$) is a solution of the eqn.

eg (1,0,1,2) is a solution of the equation $2x_{1}-x_{2}-3x_{3}+x_{4}=1$

$a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+...+a_{n}x_{n} = b$ has a solution(s) __unless__ $a_{1}=a_{2}=...=a_{n}=0$ and $b \neq 0$
